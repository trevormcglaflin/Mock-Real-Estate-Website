    <h3><b>Founding Story</b></h3>
    <p>
        McGlaflin Crib Co. started in 2020 with the goal of delivering the most desirable houses in the 
        hills region to our clients while providing the most fun, yet professional, buying experience. 
        Our founder, Trevor McGlaflin, has 20 years of realty experience and has initiated real estate 
        transactions with NBA players, movie actors, and famous CEO's. We primarily sell secondary homes for 
        leisure, bachelor/bachelorette pads, or just for fun. However, we normally will have some residential offerings
        for primary estates. 
    </p>
    <h3><b>Buying Process</b></h3>
    <p>
        <p>We break the house buying experience into a 4 step process</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Discuss: tell us what you are looking for very specifically</li>
            <li>Research: we will research our available houses and find some that are well suited to you</li>
            <li>Execute: we will tour these houses and put the choice in your hands</li>
            <li>Celebrate: we will help you celebrate your new purchase by organizing a house warming party</li>
        </ol>
